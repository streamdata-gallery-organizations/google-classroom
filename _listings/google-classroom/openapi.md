      summary: Create Guardian Invitation
      description: |-
        Creates a guardian invitation, and sends an email to the guardian asking
        them to confirm that they are the student's guardian.

        Once the guardian accepts the invitation, their `state` will change to
        `COMPLETED` and they will start receiving guardian notifications. A
        `Guardian` resource will also be created to represent the active guardian.

        The request object must have the `student_id` and
        `invited_email_address` fields set. Failing to set these fields, or
        setting any other fields in the request, will result in an error.

        This method returns the following error codes:

        * `PERMISSION_DENIED` if the current user does not have permission to
          manage guardians, if the guardian in question has already rejected
          too many requests for that student, if guardians are not enabled for the
          domain in question, or for other access errors.
        * `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` if the student or guardian has exceeded the guardian
          link limit.
        * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the guardian email address is not valid (for
          example, if it is too long), or if the format of the student ID provided
          cannot be recognized (it is not an email address, nor a `user_id` from
          this API). This error will also be returned if read-only fields are set,
          or if the `state` field is set to to a value other than `PENDING`.
        * `NOT_FOUND` if the student ID provided is a valid student ID, but
          Classroom has no record of that student.
        * `ALREADY_EXISTS` if there is already a pending guardian invitation for
          the student and `invited_email_address` provided, or if the provided
          `invited_email_address` matches the Google account of an existing
          `Guardian` for this user.

        Modifies a guardian invitation.

        Currently, the only valid modification is to change the `state` from
        `PENDING` to `COMPLETE`. This has the effect of withdrawing the invitation.

        This method returns the following error codes:

        * `PERMISSION_DENIED` if the current user does not have permission to
          manage guardians, if guardians are not enabled for the domain in question

          cannot be recognized (it is not an email address, nor a `user_id` from
          this API), or if the passed `GuardianInvitation` has a `state` other than
          `COMPLETE`, or if it modifies fields other than `state`.

          Classroom has no record of that student, or if the `id` field does not
          refer to a guardian invitation known to Classroom.
